# SAFi (Self-Alignment Framework Interface)

SAFi is the first open-source implementation of the Self-Alignment Framework (SAF), a closed-loop ethical reasoning engine. SAFi is not a language model itself, but a governor that evaluates and audits the behavior of AI models like GPT, Claude, or Llama through a five-faculty reasoning loop:

**Values ‚Üí Intellect ‚Üí Will ‚Üí Conscience ‚Üí Spirit**

This loop turns ethics into system logic, ensuring transparency, accountability, and drift detection in AI behavior.

## Live Demo & Dashboard

You can try SAFi live and view the administrative dashboard here:

* **SAFi Application**: [safi.selfalignmentframework.com](https://safi.selfalignmentframework.com)
* **SAFi Admin Dashboard**: [dashboard.selfalignmentframework.com](https://dashboard.selfalignmentframework.com)

*(Please note: The public demo is rate-limited to 10 prompts per user per day.)*

## Features

### üß† Modular Architecture

* **Intellect Engine**: Generates the initial answer and a private reflection using a Large Language Model (e.g., Anthropic's Claude).
* **Will Gate**: A fast, rule-based safety layer using an OpenAI model that enforces non-negotiable rules and can block responses before they reach the user.
* **Conscience Auditor**: An evaluation layer that scores the final output against the set of values, providing a detailed audit ledger.
* **Spirit Integrator**: A long-term memory component that updates an ethical performance vector over time, creating a self-correction feedback loop for the Intellect.

### üé≠ Swappable Ethical Profiles

* A user can switch SAFi's ethical profile from the front-end of the application.
* Includes pre-built profiles like a Virtue Ethics Advisor, Cognitive Therapy guide, Financial Planner, and Health Advocate.
* Each profile includes a unique worldview, style, rules for the Will and a set of values.

### üí¨ Full-Featured Chat Application

* **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and user management via Google OAuth.
* **Persistent Conversations**: Full chat history is saved to a MySQL database, allowing users to continue conversations across sessions.
* **Conversation Summarization**: A background job maintains a running summary of the conversation to provide the SAFi with coherent short-term memory.
* **Asynchronous Auditing**: Users receive a fast initial response while the detailed ethical audit runs in the background, with results updated in real-time.

### ‚öôÔ∏è System & Auditing

* **Multi-Model Integration**: Uses models from both OpenAI and Anthropic, assigning them to the faculties where they perform best.
* **Structured JSON Logging**: Detailed logs of every AI turn‚Äîincluding internal drafts, reflections, audit ledgers, and memory vectors‚Äîare saved to daily, per-profile JSONL files for complete transparency.
* **Database Persistence**: User data, conversation history, and the AI's long-term spirit memory are all stored in a MySQL database.
* **Environment-Based Configuration**: Easily configure the application with environment variables for API keys, models, and database connections.

## Installation

### Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* MySQL Server
* Virtualenv (recommended)
* API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jnamaya/SAFi.git
cd SAFi

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# --- Edit .env to add your API keys and MySQL credentials ---

# Initialize and run the application
flask run
```

### Configuration

* **.env** ‚Äì Contains all runtime settings, API keys, model names, and database connection details.
* **safi\_app/values.py** ‚Äì Contains the persona profiles (worldview, style, rules, and value sets). You can edit this file to create or modify personas.
* **logs/** ‚Äì Log files are written here, organized by profile and date (e.g., `planner-2025-08-31.jsonl`).
