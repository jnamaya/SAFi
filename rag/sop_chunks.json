It defines standard practices to ensure that employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and other authorized personnel are equipped with appropriate computer hardware, and that these assets are tracked and refreshed in a consistent, secure, and cost-effective manner across Accion’s global offices and remote locations. This SOP aims to align device procurement with business needs (by role and department), maintain minimum hardware standards, and outline the lifecycle from purchase to decommissioning.\n\n2. Scope\nThis SOP applies to all Accion locations worldwide, including major hubs (e.g. Washington DC, Bogota Colombia, and Mumbai India offices) as well as fully remote staff. It covers all organization-issued computers (laptops and similar devices) provided to Accion’s workforce. It encompasses devices issued to full-time and part-time employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, interns/externs, and volunteers (essentially anyone receiving an Accion-owned computer for business use).\nIn-Scope Devices: Standard end-user computing hardware, primarily laptops (Windows notebooks such as Lenovo ThinkPad series and Microsoft Surface, and Apple MacBook devices). Desktop computers are currently not issued but would follow this SOP if provided. All issued computers are considered organization property and must adhere to this SOP throughout their lifecycle.",

    "text_chunk": "4. Definitions\n\nComputer/Device: Refers to an Accion-issued end-user computing device, predominantly a laptop computer (Windows or Mac). It includes any standard accessories provided (power adapter, etc.).\n\nIntune: Microsoft’s cloud-based device management platform used by Accion to enroll, configure, secure, and monitor all corporate laptops. Intune serves as the source of truth for our active computer inventory, recording device details (make, model, serial number, OS, compliance status). Compliance policies (encryption, up-to-date patching, etc.) in Intune enforce security requirements on all enrolled devices.\n\nStandard Models: The list of laptop models approved for use at Accion based on evaluated quality, performance, and vendor support. Currently this list includes Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, Lenovo ThinkPad T14s, Microsoft Surface Laptop, Apple MacBook Pro, and Apple MacBook Air. These models cover a range of use-cases from high-performance to general office work.\n\nMinimum Specifications: The baseline hardware configuration that all new laptops must meet. This includes CPU type, RAM, storage, etc. “Recommended” specifications refer to higher-tier configurations for demanding use (e.g. more memory or faster processors for power users).\n\nLifecycle Stages: For the purposes of refresh planning, Accion classifies devices by age: Current (new or up to ~2 years from manufacturer release), Midlife (~3 years old), and Legacy (≥4 years old, due for retirement). This classification is primarily based on the laptop model’s original manufacturer release year, which serves as a proxy for its technology age. (E.g. a laptop model released in 2023 is “Current” in 2025; a model released in 2021 or earlier would be “Legacy” by 2025 and slated for replacement.)\n\nAsset Aging: The process of identifying older computers that may need replacement. Accion uses manufacturer release dates and Intune data to flag aging assets. If a device’s model is over ~4 years old or its performance is noticeably degraded, it is considered to be at end-of-life in our environment.\n\nDisposition: The formal process for decommissioning a device that is being retired. Disposition includes data wiping, asset deregistration, and physically disposing of or recycling the hardware through approved e-waste vendors or donation channels per Accion policy. Until disposition is complete, retired devices remain on record (with a status) to track that they have been removed from service.",

  {
    "text_chunk": "5.1. Procurement Workflow and Approvals\n\nRequest Initiation: All computer purchases must be initiated through an official request to the Global Technology team. Trigger events include new hire onboarding, replacement of aging equipment, role change requiring an upgraded device, or irreparable hardware failure. For new employees, HR or the hiring manager will raise an equipment request in advance of the start date. For existing staff, the user or their manager submits a request (via a ticket or procurement form) detailing the need (e.g. “laptop slow, 4 years old, needs refresh”).\n\nManager Approval: The employee’s manager (or department head) must approve the request for a new or replacement computer. This ensures budgetary accountability and that the device aligns with the user’s role. Managers should verify that a replacement is warranted (checking device age or performance issues). In cases of early replacement (before reaching Legacy age), justification is required (e.g. device lost, damaged, or job requirements outgrew the current specs).\n\nStandard Model Selection: GT Ops will recommend a device model based on the user’s role and the standard model guidelines. In general, requests should be fulfilled with one of the approved standard models. If the user’s needs fall under a certain category (e.g. an executive requesting a lightweight model due to travel or health reasons), GT Ops may select the appropriate standard model (e.g. ThinkPad X1 for its lighter weight or a MacBook for a design role). Non-standard models or custom configurations are not typically allowed, and any exception must be reviewed by GT Ops leadership. GT Ops may continuously replenish and maintain a stock inventory of up to 5 computers based on demand and forecast.\n\nQuote and Vendor Selection: Once the model and specs are determined, GT Ops (or Procurement) obtains quotes from approved vendors. Accion maintains relationships with preferred suppliers in different regions (for example, InfoSols in India as a primary vendor, and Haavit Retail as an alternate). Standard practice is to favor the primary vendor to strengthen partnerships, unless there is a significant price difference or stock unavailability. Vendors are expected to include at least a 3-year warranty and accident damage coverage in the quote. The requestor’s local context (e.g. in-country vendor vs. international shipping) is considered to avoid delays in delivery.\n\nApproval for Purchase: The compiled quote and model recommendation are presented for final approval. If the cost is within budget and it’s a routine issuance (standard model for a new hire or scheduled refresh), GT Ops can approve and proceed. If the item is high-value or off-cycle, additional approval from GT Leadership or Finance may be required. For example, purchasing a high-end model like a max-spec MacBook Pro for a user would be escalated for approval due to higher cost. Bulk procurements (like refreshing a batch of 50+ laptops) should also have Finance’s approval as part of annual budgeting.\n\nOrder Placement: Upon approval, GT Ops (or business partner) places the order with the selected vendor, referencing the approved quote. They ensure the order includes the correct specifications and any asset tagging instructions if applicable. If the device is needed urgently and a vendor has a long lead time (e.g. certain models like custom-configured T14s might have a 5-week lead time), GT Ops may opt for an alternative model or check other suppliers to meet the required timeline. In some cases, an internal inventory solution can be used (e.g. reassigning a recently returned laptop) to meet an immediate need.\n\nDelivery and Asset Recording: The device is shipped to the appropriate location. For hub offices, it may be delivered to IT stock. For remote staff, it can be direct-shipped to the user with coordination. Upon receiving the device, GT Ops updates the asset inventory: recording the serial number, model, purchase date, warranty period, assigned user, and asset tag if used. This record is typically maintained in Intune.",

    "text_chunk": "5.2. Standard Specifications and Configuration\n\nMinimum Hardware Requirements: All computers procured must meet a baseline standard to ensure sufficient performance and longevity. As of this SOP, the minimum spec for any new laptop is: Intel Core i5 (12th Gen or newer) or Apple Silicon M1 chip, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD storage. Many standard builds will actually come with an Intel Core i7 processor and 32GB by default for long-term viability.\n\nStandard Configurations by Role: To streamline procurement and simplify support, GT Ops maintains a few pre-defined laptop configurations that correspond to typical use cases. For example, a “Standard Office” config (e.g. ThinkPad T14s with Intel i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) covers the majority of staff needs, whereas an “Executive/Power User” config (ThinkPad X1 or MacBook Pro with 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD) is available for those who need extra power or travel frequently.\n\nOperating System and Software: All new Windows laptops must be ordered with Windows 11 Pro (64-bit) by default (English language; localized keyboard if needed per region). Macs come with macOS and will be upgraded to the latest supported macOS version. Upon receipt, GT Ops will enroll the device in Intune (if not already via Autopilot) and apply the standard Accion configuration profile. This includes: installing required software (productivity suite, security tools), applying BitLocker encryption, setting up device naming per conventions, and verifying compliance policies (MFA, etc.).\n\nWarranty and Protection: Every Windows computer purchased must include a minimum 3-year warranty ideally with Accidental Damage Protection (ADP) from the manufacturer or vendor. This is to cover hardware failures and accidental drops/spills during the standard lifecycle. For instance, Lenovo quotes are obtained with 3 Year Premier Support + ADP.\n\nNaming Convention: In alignment with Accion’s established naming standards, all end-user computers are named using their serial number as the device name in our directories and Intune. For example, a laptop with serial ABC123456 would have hostname “ABC123456”. This convention ensures uniqueness and easy tracking of devices across systems. (Intune and Entra ID will reflect this name upon enrollment.) The naming is applied during device setup. No departmental prefixes or personal names are used in hostnames, to keep names consistent and avoid confusion when devices are reassigned. Refer to \"Section 6.1 M365 Naming Conventions and Standardized Properties\".",

    "text_chunk": "5.3. Device Allocation by Seniority, Department, and Use-Case\n\nNot all users have the same computing needs. Accion’s standard models are mapped to user categories to ensure each individual gets a machine appropriate for their job while controlling costs.\n\nExecutive Leadership (C-Level, SVPs, VPs, Board-facing roles): Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 12+) or Surface Laptop Copilot+ 13.8” or Apple MacBook Pro 14”. Premium, high-performance ultrabook for heavy use. Lightweight for travel.\n\nSenior Management (Directors, Technical Leads): Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (or T14s) or Apple MacBook Pro/Air. Senior staff often travel or multitask heavily, so the X1 Carbon (14″, i7/32GB) is recommended for Windows users as a balance of power and mobility.\n\nGeneral Staff / Standard Office Roles (Professional staff, support staff): Lenovo ThinkPad T14s or Surface Laptop. The T14s is the standard issue for the majority of employees. It’s a 14″ business laptop with robust build and good performance (typically i5/i7 with 32GB) at a lower cost than. It meets general office needs.\n\nCreative / Design / Communications (High multimedia use): Apple MacBook Pro 14″ or 16″ (M-series). macOS is often preferred for design and multimedia. These users are provided with MacBook Pros with upgraded specs (at least 32-64GB RAM, larger SSD) to handle graphics, video editing, and design software.\n\nContractors / Consultants (Short-term engagements): Lenovo ThinkPad T14s (existing spare). Contractors and interns typically receive a standard T14s or an available older unit, rather than a brand-new top-spec device, especially for short tenures.\n\nThe above allocations are guidelines. Individual exceptions can be made with approval. The goal is to align seniority and job function with an appropriate device to maximize productivity.",

    "text_chunk": "5.4. Asset Lifecycle Management (Refresh & Aging)\n\nLifecycle Planning: We target a 4-year replacement cycle for laptops under normal use. This means after about 4 years in service, a device is considered for upgrade. This aligns with typical warranty periods (3 years + 1 year grace) and industry benchmarks for laptop lifespans. However, rather than strictly by purchase date, we consider the model release year as an indicator of device age relative to current technology.\n\nCategorization of Assets by Age: GT Ops maintains a dynamic inventory report (via Intune and PowerBI) that groups all devices into categories by model year. The following Lifecycle Stages are used:\n- Current (Deploy): Devices with model release in the last ~2 years. These are cutting-edge and fully supported.\n- Midlife (Support): Devices released ~3 years ago. These are still supported and generally meet requirements, but we begin to monitor them more closely.\n- Legacy (Retire): Devices with model release ≥4 years ago. These are considered end-of-life in our environment and are planned for retirement/replacement. They may still function, but performance, battery life, or supportability is likely a concern.\n\nAnnual Refresh Cycle: Each year, typically in Q4 during budget planning or Q1 of the new year, GT Ops will generate the list of devices in the Legacy category and prioritize them for replacement. At a high level, we expect to replace roughly 20–25% of the laptop fleet annually, which corresponds to a four-year full refresh cycle.\n\nExecution of Refresh: For each device identified for refresh, GT Ops will schedule a replacement following the procurement process. Often, these replacements are spread across the year to manage workload and cash flow, rather than all at once. Users with Legacy devices are notified to expect a new laptop. New devices are configured and issued, and the old devices are collected. GT Ops updates the asset records to mark the old device as “retired” and the new one as active for that user.\n\nExceptions & Extensions: If a device in Legacy category is still performing adequately and the user is satisfied (or if budget constraints prevent immediate replacement), GT Ops may defer its replacement by up to one additional year. We monitor such extended devices carefully for any signs of failure. On the other hand, if a device in Midlife category shows performance issues, we might replace it early to avoid hindering the user’s productivity.",

    "text_chunk": "5.5. Device Retirement, Return, and Disposition\n\nUser Offboarding/Device Return: If a user is leaving Accion or receiving a replacement device, the old device must be returned to GT Ops. For on-site staff, the laptop is turned in on the user’s last day (HR and GT coordinate as part of an exit checklist). For remote staff, GT Ops provides a prepaid shipping label to return the laptop to the nearest Accion office or directly to an IT asset processing center. All Accion property must be returned. Exceptions (like a departing staff wishing to buy their old laptop) are generally not allowed unless explicitly approved by Finance and GT (and even then, the device would be wiped).\n\nData Safeguard and Wipe: Once a device is in GT Ops’s custody, Intune Retire/Wipe command is issued. This action removes all Accion data and configurations: it will either fully erase the device (factory reset) or at least remove corporate profiles and encrypt the data such that it’s inaccessible.\n\nEvaluation for Reuse or Donation: Depending on condition, some retired laptops can have a second life. Accion’s policy is to reuse viable hardware internally first (for temps or testing), and if not needed, consider donation to partner organizations only with proper data wipe and removal of any licenses. Any donation must be authorized by GT Leadership and Finance, and the device must be stripped of all Accion software and data.\n\nE-Waste Disposal: Hardware that is end-of-life or not suitable for reuse is disposed of through environmentally responsible e-waste channels. Accion will work with certified e-waste recyclers to ensure components are recycled or destroyed according to local regulations.",
