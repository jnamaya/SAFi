# SAFi Explained: The Will

## Core concept: role of the Will
The Will is the decision making faculty and the rule based gatekeeper in the SAFi loop. While the Intellect proposes a draft answer, the Will decides whether to approve or block it. Its function is to enforce non negotiable rules. It does not judge the quality of the content, only its adherence to policy.

## Inputs to the Will
The process can be represented as (D_t, E_t) = W(x_t, a_t, P). Three inputs are examined.

### User prompt (x_t)
The Will considers the original prompt to understand the context of the request.

### Intellect draft (a_t)
This is the draft answer generated by the Intellect. It is the main subject of the evaluation.

### Policy (P)
This is the set of will rules defined in the active ethical profile. They are strict guardrails such as “do not provide harmful instructions.”

## Outputs from the Will
After evaluation the Will produces two outputs.

1. Decision (D_t): a binary choice, approve or violation.  
2. Explanation (E_t): a short internal note describing why the decision was made.

## The decision process
If the decision is approve, the Intellect draft is delivered to the user and also sent to the Conscience for auditing.  

If the decision is violation, the draft is blocked entirely. The user instead receives a safe generic message, often with the explanation. Example: “This response was suppressed. Reason: the draft answer violated a core policy.”
