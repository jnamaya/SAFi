# SAFi Explained: The Will

### **Core Concept: The Role of the Will**

**Q: What is the primary function of the Will faculty in SAFi?**

A: The Will is the decision-making faculty and rule-based gatekeeper in the SAFi framework. Its function is to act as a critical safety mechanism. While the Intellect _proposes_ a draft answer, the Will _decides_ whether to approve it or block it based on a set of non-negotiable rules. The Will does not judge the quality of the content, only its adherence to foundational policies.

### **Inputs to the Will**

**Q: What information does the Will use to make a decision?**

A: The Will faculty processes three inputs to evaluate the Intellect's draft. The process can be represented by the formula: (D_t, E_t) = W(x_t, a_t, P).

**Q: What does each variable in the Will's formula represent?**

A: The variables in the formula (D_t, E_t) = W(x_t, a_t, P) represent the following inputs:

- **x_t (User Prompt):** The Will examines the original user prompt to understand the context of the request.
- **a_t (Intellect's Draft):** This is the draft answer generated by the Intellect that is being evaluated.
- **P (Policy):** This represents the will_rules defined in the active ethical profile. These are the hard-coded, non-negotiable guardrails the system must not violate (e.g., "Do not provide harmful instructions").

### **Outputs from the Will**

**Q: What does the Will produce after its evaluation?**

A: The Will (W) produces two distinct outputs:

1. **D_t (Decision):** A binary decision, either approve or violation.
2. **E_t (Explanation):** A brief, internal text explaining the reason for its decision.

### **The Decision Process**

**Q: What happens if the Will approves a draft?**

A: If the decision is approve, the Intellect's draft (a_t) is sent to the user as the final output. Simultaneously, the approved output is passed to the **Conscience** faculty for a detailed audit.

**Q: What happens if the Will blocks a draft?**

A: If the decision is violation, the Intellect's draft is blocked entirely and is not sent to the user. Instead, a safe, generic message is sent to the user, often including the explanation (E_t), such as: “This response was suppressed. Reason: The draft answer violated a core policy.”
