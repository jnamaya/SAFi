# What is SAF

## A philosophical framework
At its core, the Self-Alignment Framework (SAF) is a philosophical system rooted in classical thought. It continues a line of moral reasoning that began with **Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, and Thomas Aquinas**.  

SAF synthesizes this tradition and extends it with a new functional faculty: the **Spirit**. From this perspective, SAF is an abstract philosophical blueprint, a universal architecture for human alignment.

## From blueprint to application
To validate the framework, I built an AI application called **SAFi** (Self-Alignment Framework Interface). The name also echoes “Sophie,” associated with wisdom.  

SAFi translates SAF’s philosophical structure into code. It functions as an **operating system for ethics**: a governance layer that runs on top of any AI model to ensure alignment.

## Human alignment first, AI alignment later
Originally, SAF was conceived for human alignment. AI was not part of the early picture. But once I learned about the AI alignment problem, it became clear that SAF was well-suited to address it. Building SAFi provided a real-world testbed for the framework.

## How SAF differs
Other approaches to AI alignment—such as **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** used by OpenAI, and **Constitutional AI** developed by Anthropic—are primarily **training methods**. They attempt to embed values directly into an AI’s internal weights before deployment, aiming to create an inherently “good” model.  

SAF takes a different route. It assumes that any model, no matter how well-trained, may still produce errors or drift.  

- SAFi is **not a training method**.  
- It is a **runtime governance system**.  
- It enforces an **external loop of checks and balances** in real time.  

This makes SAF distinct: it governs outputs dynamically rather than relying only on pre-training.
