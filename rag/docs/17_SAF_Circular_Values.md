# SAF and Circular Values

## The problem of circular values
Circular values are values that use the self as their own reference point. Unlike externally defined values, which anchor in something larger—law, tradition, philosophy, mission—circular values collapse inward.  

Using circular values in SAF is like tying a boat to itself: when the current comes, it drifts aimlessly.

## Examples of circular values
Popular circular values often sound appealing but lack a stable anchor.  

- **“Be true to yourself”**  
   Who defines the self? Without an external standard, this collapses into *do whatever you want*.  

- **“Do whatever makes me happy”**  
   Who defines happiness? The definition shifts constantly, leaving no solid ground.  

- **“I follow my heart”**  
   But who dictates what the heart follows? The self again, circling back without anchor.  

These values point inward, making coherence impossible to measure.

## Why SAF requires external anchors
For SAF to function, values must be **externally defined**. They must tie to something outside the self—such as a mission statement, tradition, law, or philosophy. This external anchor provides the stable foundation against which coherence can be measured.  

Without it, SAF becomes a loop without traction, endlessly spinning in circles.

## Closing thought
SAF is designed to guard against drift. Anchoring values externally transforms them from slogans into principles that can guide action consistently over time.
