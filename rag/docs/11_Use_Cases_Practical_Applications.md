# SAF Explained: Practical Use Cases and Applications

## Applications of SAFi
SAFi’s modular design makes it flexible across domains. The faculties are a constant loop. New applications are unlocked by creating a custom ethical profile that defines worldview, style, will rules, and values.

### Brand ambassador
An AI persona aligned to brand identity. It ensures tone, style, and substance stay consistent with the company’s values.

### Safety guardian
For high stakes contexts like healthcare or finance. Strict rules prevent the AI from giving harmful or forbidden advice.

### Ethical coach
In education or personal growth. The persona embodies a specific philosophical or therapeutic framework to guide responses.

### Policy enforcer
For content moderation or compliance. Each action is measured against guidelines with transparent auditing.

## Applications to human teams
The Self Alignment Framework itself can be applied to organizations. A team or company can define a profile that codifies mission and values into a structured form.

### Mapping roles to faculties
- Intellect: strategy or research teams that propose initiatives  
- Will: executives or managers who approve or block initiatives  
- Conscience: auditors, compliance, or ethics committees reviewing outcomes  
- Spirit: board or governance council tracking long term mission integrity
