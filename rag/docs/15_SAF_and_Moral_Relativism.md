# SAF and Moral Relativism

## The question: are all values equally true
Following the discussion on universality, a pressing question arises: if everyone can load their own values into SAF, does this mean that all values are equally valid or true?  

This debate touches on the heart of pluralistic societies and is critical for understanding SAF’s role.

## SAF as a tool, not a moral agent
The first clarification is simple: SAF is a tool, not a moral agent. It has no self-awareness, no conscience of its own, and no capacity to distinguish good from evil.  

Its function is narrow but powerful: to measure **coherence**—the consistency between the values you declare and the actions you take. It cannot establish the truth of those values.

## Coherence vs. truth
Coherence should not be confused with truth. A dangerous ideology can be internally consistent without being morally right.  

For example, Hitler could have used a framework like SAF to ensure his hateful narrative was coherent. That would not have made his ideology just. The responsibility for morality rests entirely with the human who defines the values and employs the framework.

## The human responsibility
This distinction highlights a fundamental point: **moral agency always remains with the human**. SAF simply enforces alignment with chosen values. Whether those values serve justice, goodness, or flourishing is a matter beyond the tool’s scope.

## Analogies with other universal processes
SAF is not unique in this respect. Other universal tools work the same way:  

- **Double-entry bookkeeping** ensures financial accounts are consistent, but does not guarantee the business is just.  
- **The scientific method** ensures conclusions fit data, but does not guarantee research serves humanity’s well-being.  

The integrity lies in the process. The morality lies in the application.

## Toward a shared premise
Ultimately, truth is only as good as the premises you start with. If there is a possible shared foundation, it may be this: *good is whatever leads to human flourishing*. SAF helps measure coherence to those premises, but it cannot supply them.
