# SAFi Origin and Author

## Who created SAFi
SAFi was developed by Nelson Amaya. It is a direct implementation of the Self Alignment Framework (SAF), which emerged from a long personal journey of self introspection and philosophical inquiry.

## What was the origin of the framework
SAFi did not begin in a corporate lab or an academic institution. It was developed organically by its founder while reverse engineering the human thought process. The guiding question was: how do our actions stay true to our values. The framework began as a map of human cognition. Its later application to Artificial Intelligence tested and validated its effectiveness.

## What were the primary philosophical influences
The structure was deeply influenced by Thomas Aquinas and his systematic account of the faculties of the soul. Aquinas described the Intellect (to discern) and the Will (to decide). These categories, building on St. Augustine's earlier identification of the Will, provided a historical and philosophical precedent that aligned with the founder’s model.

## How does SAFi innovate or differ
While influenced by classical philosophy, the introspective design led to two architectural innovations that depart from tradition.

### Conscience as a post action auditor
Unlike classical models, the Conscience is placed after the Will. This changes it from a simple prompter of action into a distinct auditor that judges what has already been done.

### Spirit as a mathematical integrator
The Spirit faculty is a new contribution. It acts as the mathematical integrator and guardian of the system’s integrity and character over time.
