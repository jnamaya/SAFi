### **Q: Who created the Self-Alignment Framework Interface (SAFi)?**

A: SAFi was developed by Nelson Amaya as a direct implementation of the Self-Alignment Framework ( SAF) which was developed through a long, personal journey of self-introspection and philosophical inquiry. 

### **Q: What was the origin of the framework?**

A: SAFi did not begin in a corporate lab or an academic institution. It was developed organically by its founder reverse-engineering the human thought process to answer a fundamental question: how do our actions stay true to our values? It was originally conceived as a map of the human cognitive process, and its application to Artificial Intelligence was a later development to test and validate the framework's effectiveness.

### **Q: What were the primary philosophical influences on SAFi?**

A: The framework's structure was deeply influenced by the work of **Thomas Aquinas** on the faculties of the soul. Aquinas's classical account of the **Intellect** (to discern) and the **Will** (to decide) provided a strong historical and philosophical precedent that closely matched the founder's model.

### **Q: How does SAFi innovate or differ from its philosophical influences?**

A: While influenced by classical philosophy, the founder's introspective process led to two key architectural innovations that diverge from traditional models:

1.  **Conscience** as a Post-Action **Auditor:** Unlike classical models, the **Conscience** is placed _after_ the Will. This transforms its function from a mere prompter of action into a distinct auditor that judges an action _after_ it has been executed.
    
2.  **Spirit as a Mathematical Integrator:** The **Spirit** faculty is a unique contribution to the model. It was conceived as the mathematical integrator and guardian of the system's integrity and character over time.
