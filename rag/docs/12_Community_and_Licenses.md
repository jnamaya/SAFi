# SAF Explained: Community and Future Vision

## Open source model
The project is committed to transparency and collaboration through a dual license structure.

- The SAF framework (theory) is released under the MIT license. This allows free adoption, discussion, and research without restriction.  
- SAFi (software) is released under the GPLv3 license. This copyleft license ensures derivative works remain open source.  

## Long term vision
The vision is a world where complex systems, including AI, corporations, and public institutions, use a common auditable protocol for self regulation. This fosters coherence, transparency, and accountability across all sectors.

## Getting involved
The best way to start is by exploring the documentation and resources provided in the SAFi project. Community participation, research, and discussion are encouraged.
