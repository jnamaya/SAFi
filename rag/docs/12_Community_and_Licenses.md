### **Q:** Is the Self-Alignment **Framework an open-source project?**

A: Yes. The project is committed to transparency and community collaboration through a dual-license model:

1.  **The SAF Framework (The Theory):** The conceptual framework itself is released under the permissive **MIT License**. This is to encourage the widest possible adoption, discussion, and research of the underlying ideas without restriction.
    
2.  **SAFi (The Software):** The reference software implementation, SAFi, is released under the **GPLv3 License**. This "copyleft" license ensures that any derivative works of the software also remain open-source, fostering a collaborative and transparent community around the tool itself.
    

### **Q: What is the long-term vision for SAF?**

A: The vision is a world where complex systems—including AI, corporations, and public institutions—are equipped with a common, auditable protocol for self-regulation. This would enable them to operate with greater coherence, transparency, and responsibility, fostering a new era of trust and accountability across all sectors of society.
