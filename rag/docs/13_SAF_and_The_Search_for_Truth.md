# SAF and The Search for Truth

## Core question: objective truth
As the creator of the Self-Alignment Framework (SAF), I’ve had to wrestle with one of the enduring questions of moral philosophy: does objective truth exist?  

For me as a Christian, the answer is yes. Faith itself rests on the conviction that truth is not relative, but real and binding. That conviction shaped the design of SAF. My primary goal was to avoid building a relativistic framework that drifts with cultural trends or subjective moods.

## The anchor: externally defined values
This is why SAF requires that values be *externally defined*. This non-negotiable step is what anchors the framework in something stable and enduring. Without it, the loop risks collapsing into self-reference.  

For me personally, my values are anchored in the teachings of the Church. But SAF was designed to be broader: it honors the diversity of human experience, where values shift from culture to culture, institution to institution, and person to person.

## The design choice: values as input
To honor that diversity, I made a deliberate design choice. In SAF, values are not predefined by the system. They are an input—a slot to be filled by whoever is using the framework.  

- An organization can load its mission and core values.  
- A religious institution can load its doctrines or sacred texts.  
- An individual can load personal principles that guide growth.  

This makes SAF both structurally non-relativistic and content-agnostic. The structure is fixed, but the content is open, making it universal.

## A universal compass
This design reflects another conviction: while I personally believe that values are pathways that lead toward universal truth, the routes are not identical. Each person, culture, or institution builds a unique relationship with that higher order. For Christians, this includes the gift of divine grace.  

SAF itself does not define the destination. Instead, it provides a reliable compass—a closed-loop process to help individuals and organizations stay coherent with their declared values as they move along their journey.
