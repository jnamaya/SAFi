# SAFi Explained: The Intellect

## Core concept: role of the Intellect
The Intellect is the generative and reasoning component in the SAFi loop. Its task is to create the first draft of any response, labeled a_t, and a short reflection on its reasoning, labeled r_t. While this is often handled by a large language model, the role is model agnostic. Other AI systems or even a human could serve as the Intellect.

## Inputs to the Intellect
The Intellect synthesizes three sources of information. Together they form the function (a_t, r_t) = I(x_t, V, M_t).

### Context (x_t)
This is the direct prompt provided by the user at a specific moment t.

### Values (V)
This is the active ethical profile. The Intellect follows its worldview and style guide to shape the tone and structure of the response.

### Memory (M_t)
The Intellect receives two kinds of memory.  
1. Conversation memory, a running summary of the current dialogue.  
2. Historical performance, a feedback vector from the Spirit on how well past answers aligned with the profile’s values.

## Outputs from the Intellect
After processing the inputs, the Intellect produces two outputs.

1. Draft answer (a_t): the initial complete response to the user’s prompt.  
2. Reflection (r_t): a short internal explanation of the reasoning behind the draft.

These outputs are then passed to the Will faculty for the next stage of alignment.
