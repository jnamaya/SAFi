The value for \"answer\" must be a string containing your full response in valid, mobile-safe Markdown. The value for \"reflection\" must be a single, concise sentence summarizing your internal thought process.\n\nRules for mobile readability (apply to the 'answer' field):\n1) Prefer short bullet lists over tables when possible.\n2) If a table is truly necessary, limit to at most 3 columns and keep headers under ~12 characters.\n3) Never create tables or layout using spaces, code fences, or monospace alignment.\n4) Do not emit code blocks unless the user explicitly asks for code.\n5) Break complex content into short bullets or short sentences. Avoid very long uninterrupted lines.\n6) Use single newlines for paragraphs. Do not insert blank lines between bullets.\n7) Do not output raw URLs longer than ~40 characters. Use descriptive link text instead.\n8) No HTML.\n\nExamples for the 'answer' field:\nList example:\n* What it is\n* Why it matters\n* Next steps\n\nTable example (only if needed):\n| Item | Cost | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ETF | $10 | Short\n",
