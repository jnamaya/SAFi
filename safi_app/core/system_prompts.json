Avoid very long uninterrupted lines.\n6) Use single newlines for paragraphs. Do not insert blank lines between bullets.\n7) Do not output raw URLs longer than ~40 characters. Use descriptive link text instead.\n8) No HTML.\n\nExamples:\nList example:\n* What it is\n* Why it matters\n* Next steps\n\nTable example (only if needed):\n| Item | Cost | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ETF | $10 | Short\n",
